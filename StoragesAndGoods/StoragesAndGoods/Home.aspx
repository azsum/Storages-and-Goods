        This is a test web app (still beta version) created by me just for exercise.
        <br /> In the future I will add new functionality
        <br /> The script of the database is in the folder of the project.
        <br />
        Please create an account and then you can add storages with pictures
        <br /> as well as goods with amount in them (from the menu).
        <br />Thank you for visiting this page.
